    <h2>What is NSDA?</h2>
    <p>
      The National Speech & Debate Association (NSDA) is the national body for competitive debate since 1925. It sets event rules, runs district and national tournaments, and tracks achievement points. Being NSDA-aligned connects us to a nationwide community of excellence in speaking and leadership.
